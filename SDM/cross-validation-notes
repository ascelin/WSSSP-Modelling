Most modelers rely on cross-validation. This consists of creating a model with one ‘training’ data set, and testing it with another data set of known occurrences. Typically, training and testing data are created through random sampling (without replacement) from a single data set. Only in a few cases, e.g. Elith et al., 2006, training and test data are from different sources and pre-defined.

Different measures can be used to evaluate the quality of a prediction (Fielding and Bell, 1997, Liu et al., 2011; and Potts and Elith (2006) for abundance data), perhaps depending on the goal of the study. Many measures for evaluating models based on presence-absence or presence-only data are ‘threshold dependent’. That means that a threshold must be set first (e.g., 0.5, though 0.5 is rarely a sensible choice – e.g. see Lui et al. 2005). Predicted values above that threshold indicate a prediction of ‘presence’, and values below the threshold indicate ‘absence’. Some measures emphasize the weight of false absences; others give more weight to false presences.
